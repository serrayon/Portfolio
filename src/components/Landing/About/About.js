          <p className='aboutp'>A natural curiosity for how things work, and interest in tech, has led me to study computer science. A mixture of self taught, and boot camp style programs has inspired me to focus on software quality assurance. In the last year I applied my skills to manual testing. I am now on the market and actively seeking a quality engineer role.</p>
